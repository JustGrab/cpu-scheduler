# CPU Scheduler 
Simple [CPU scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)) written in Java that also tracks process priority, burst, arrival, wait, completion, and turnaround times. CPU scheduling determines what process will own system resources for execution while other processes are on hold. The goal of the CPU scheduler is to ensure that the system is fast, efficient, and fair. 

# Algorithms
- First Come First Serve (FCFS) - A non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that executes processes in the order of their arrival.
- Round Robin (RR) - A preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed amount of time to complete their task in a cyclic manner.
